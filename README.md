# Recommender system

This repository holds our work for the EPFL 2018 Machine Learning course by :
* Arnaud Duvieusart, Msc Data Science
* Henry Declety, Msc Data Science

# Goals

With the always increasing amount of disponible content online, it is more and more important to push relevant content to users. In that sense, recommender systems became a real interest in many fields.
Our task is to implement a recommender system to predict the rating that a user would give to an item.

# Implementation
## Requirements

* Python 3
* Numpy (available `$ pip install numpy`)
* Pandas (available `$ pip install pandas`)
* Surprise (available `$ pip install scikit-surprise`)
* Keras (available with Anaconda `$ conda install -c conda-forge keras`) 
* Sklearn (available `$ pip install -U scikit-learn`)
* Download data from [crowdAI website](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-recommender-system/dataset_files) and place them in a data folder at the root
